# latexUtilities
In this repository you can find some LaTeX utilities that I have create to use in my daily LaTeX workflow:

## Custom Classes

- `grigerart.cls`: It is a custom class that inherits from the base `article`. This class can be use for any article or standard document that you need to write.
- `grigersli.cls` (:construction_worker: _under construction_ ): It is a custom class that inherits from the `beamer` class. I use this class to create any slides that I have to use for teaching or for a presentation in a conference.

## Other Configuration Files

- `lstconfig.tex`: This file contains a `listings` package basic configuration. This file also defines custom styles for `C++` (including Doxygen documentation comment keywords highlighting) and `Makefile` language.
